What is Carina?
Founded in 2016, Carina is a technology nonprofit that provides a safe, easy-to-use, online
location-based care matching service. We serve individuals and families searching for home
care or child care and care professionals who are looking for good jobs. Carina is committed to
building community and prioritizing people over profit. Through our partnerships with unions
and social service agencies, we build online tools to bring good jobs to care workers, so they
can focus on their passion â€” caring for others.
Our vision is a care economy that strengthens our communities by respecting and supporting
workers, individuals and families. We offer a care matching platform where verified care
providers can connect with individuals and families who need care.
